# Bova_Tools
Python toolbox intended for GIS Archaeology tools developed by Matthew Bova


STPS to Clusters:
Currently, the only tool in the toolbox is STPs to Clusters, which follows the methodology developed for my MAAC 2022 conference paper to automate the clustering process for archaeological sites. 
The tool currently suffers from long processing time due to the complexity of assembling a point grid with all the desired artifacts, does not delete all the extra files created during the process, and has the raster cell size locked.
